One bright weekend afternoon, you decide to adventure, putting on your Ring
of the Niebelungen and traveler's cloak and strapping the famed sword Ice
to your back.

Half-way up the mountain Matterhorn, you see a cave opening with steam
coming out. You enter the cave and tiptoe inside, straining your eyes in
the gloomy mist.

You encounter a dragon.

What would you like to do?

1.Try to sneak past the sleeping dragon
2.Leave the dragon's cave and go home
3.Stab the dragon in the neck

As you tiptoe past the sleeping dragon, steam rising from her nostrils, you
see a gleaming treasure hoard, just beyond the scaly tail.

An enormous, rare Scythian ruby gleams atop a pedestal, beckoning you.

What would you like to do?

1.Pick up the ruby
2.Pass the ruby to explore the rest of the hoard

who only think they are tiny dragons.

Your famed sword Ice becomes embedded in the dragon's neck scales, and the
dragon rolls over, crushing you.

Sorry, you have lost. Better luck next time!

The ruby is slippery, as though wet, and it glides through your fingers,
crashing hard into a golden plate, which clatters and crashes like a
cymbal.

The dragon wakes up, roasts you like a marshmallow, and eats you whole.

Sorry, you have lost. Better luck next time!

A mountain of treasure rises before you, but two things are more
interesting than the sapphires and gold doubloons. To your right, on a
unique and elegant coat stand, rests a silvery cloak. To your left, atop a
grand marble desk, lies an ancient book with gold-leaf trim. 

What would you like to do?

1.Put on the cloak
2.Open the book

==========
It appears to be a cloak of invisibility! You pass what should be your hand
in front of your face, but you see nothing.

Emboldened, you explore the treasure hoard further.

What would you like to do?

1.Go back and take the ruby
2.Go back and open the book

==========
The book is the original copy of All of Programming. You pore over its
contents, internalizing its every lesson.

Equipped with its knowledge, you sneak back to where the dragon is
sleeping. 

What would you like to do?

1.Exult in your skillset and go home
2.Stab the dragon in the neck

slumbers. 

What would you like to do?

2.Stab the dragon in the neck

==========
The book is the original copy of All of Programming, but the text
disappears as soon as you touch it, apparently an associative property of
your cloak of invisibility.

You do not learn to program.

In your frustration, you let out a long howl of dismay. This wakes the
dragon, who picks you up gently between her claws and deposits you in a
shallow pit with a large, craggy egg. You realize with terror that you are
to be the first meal of her hatchling.

Sorry, you have lost. Better luck next time!
