One bright weekend afternoon, you decide to adventure, putting on your Ring
of the Niebelungen and traveler's cloak and strapping the famed sword Ice
to your back.

Half-way up the mountain Matterhorn, you see a cave opening with steam
coming out. You enter the cave and tiptoe inside, straining your eyes in
the gloomy mist.

You encounter a dragon.

What would you like to do?

1.Try to sneak past the sleeping dragon
2.Leave the dragon's cave and go home
3.Stab the dragon in the neck
As you tiptoe past the sleeping dragon, steam rising from her nostrils, you
see a gleaming treasure hoard, just beyond the scaly tail.

An enormous, rare Scythian ruby gleams atop a pedestal, beckoning you.

What would you like to do?

1.Pick up the ruby
2.Pass the ruby to explore the rest of the hoard
The ruby is slippery, as though wet, and it glides through your fingers,
crashing hard into a golden plate, which clatters and crashes like a
cymbal.

The dragon wakes up, roasts you like a marshmallow, and eats you whole.

Sorry, you have lost. Better luck next time!
