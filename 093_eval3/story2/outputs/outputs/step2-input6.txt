One bright weekend afternoon, you decide to adventure, putting on your Ring
of the Niebelungen and traveler's cloak and strapping the famed sword Ice
to your back.

Half-way up the mountain Matterhorn, you see a cave opening with steam
coming out. You enter the cave and tiptoe inside, straining your eyes in
the gloomy mist.

You encounter a dragon.

What would you like to do?

 1. Try to sneak past the sleeping dragon
 2. Leave the dragon's cave and go home
 3. Stab the dragon in the neck
You enjoy a quiet evening at home with a mug of herbal tea and your cats,
who only think they are tiny dragons.

Congratulations! You have won. Hooray!
