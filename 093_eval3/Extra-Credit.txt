This assignment is released on 11/14 and due on 12/9.

Please do not wait until the last minute! We want to encourage you to start
early, so we are giving you some EXTRA CREDIT for completing the main 
portion of each step on intermediate deadlines.  By "main portion"
we mean having the core functionality working (which we will describe below).
You may wish to go back and add more error checking, handling of unusual cases,
etc later.

The extra credit is by the number of intermediate deadlines that you hit:

 4 deadlines made: +12 points  [4 more than 3 deadlines made]
 3 deadlines made: +8  points  [3 more than 2 deadlines made]
 2 deadlines made: +5  points  [3 more than 1 deadline made]
 1 deadline  made: +2  points

The indicated points are total (not cumulative)  and are added to the point
total of your assignment.  The score can go over 100 with the extra credit.

To earn this extra credit, submit to the pregrader before the deadlines shown
below.  You must pass the pregrader test cases that we provide for this purpose
(as described below).  You are, of course, encouraged to provide your own test
cases to the pregrader at any time.

Step 1: By 11/21, 11:59 PM.
-----------------------------
You should be able to run

./cyoa-step1 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story1
and
./cyoa-step1 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story2

and obtain the outputs in
/usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story1/outputs/step1-output.txt
and
/usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story2/outputs/step1-output.txt
respectively.

Step 2: By 11/28, 11:59 PM
--------------------------
Your cyoa-step2 should work on story1 and story2 for
any of the input sequences (user choices) in
/usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story1/inputs/
and
/usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story2/inputs/

You can run these with e.g.

./cyoa-step2 story1 < /usr/local/ece551/story1/inputs/input0.txt
./cyoa-step2 story1 < /usr/local/ece551/story1/inputs/input1.txt
....
./cyoa-step2 story2 < /usr/local/ece551/story2/inputs/input0.txt
./cyoa-step2 story2 < /usr/local/ece551/story2/inputs/input1.txt
....

There are corresponding output files,
/usr/local/ece551/story1/outputs/step2-input0.txt
/usr/local/ece551/story1/outputs/step2-input1.txt
....
/usr/local/ece551/story2/outputs/step2-input0.txt
/usr/local/ece551/story2/outputs/step2-input1.txt


Step 3: By 12/4, 11:59 PM
--------------------------

You should be able to run

./cyoa-step3 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story1
and
./cyoa-step3 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story2

and obtain the outputs in
/usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story1/outputs/step3-output.txt
and
/usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story2/outputs/step3-output.txt
respectively.

Step 4: By 12/7, 11:59 PM
--------------------------
Your cyoa-step4 should work with story3
with any of the inputs in
/usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story3/inputs

You can run these with e.g.

./cyoa-step4 story3 < /usr/local/ece551/story3/inputs/input0.txt
etc.

The corresponding outputs are in
/usr/local/ece551/story3/outputs/

such as
/usr/local/ece551/story3/outputs/step4-input0.txt
