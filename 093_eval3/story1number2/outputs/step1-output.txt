Page 1
==========
One day, a strange old wizard comes to your village and tells you that
there is an evil dragon lurking in the hills. This wizard's story explains
why the village's goats and cows have been going missing lately.

The wizard tells you: "It is up to you, hero, to stop this dragon. Nobody
else in this village is foolish...errrr I mean brave enough to stop this
dragon." 

The wizard offers you a choice of one of three magic items to help you on
your quest. 

The first is a magic whistle that lets you make any bird call that you
want. The second is a pair of magic shoes that let you jump 10 feet in the
air. The third is a magic toaster, which can take any item that you can fit
into it, and turn it into perfectly cooked toast (optionally with butter
and/or jam). 

"Choose wisely, for your quest and your village depend on you."

What would you like to do?

 1. Choose the magic whistle.
 2. Choose the magic shoes.
 3. Choose the magic toaster.

As you take the magic whistle from the wizard's hand, he disappears in a
puff of smoke. You decide that you should give the whistle a try before you
set off to deal with the dragon (after all, if you learned nothing else in
school, it was that testing is VERY important). 

You think of a raven and blow on the whistle "CAW CAW CAW CAW". Then you
think of a chicken and blow "COCKADOODLEDOOOO". It seems like the whistle
works great, though you wonder how many different birds you can think of
and how they would help you deal with the dragon. 

Putting that question in the back of your mind, you contemplate whether or
not you should get some help before you set out. On the one hand, if you go
alone, you might be able to better sneak into the dragon's lair. On the
other hand, help might be useful.

Fortunately for you, the two wisest people you know, Denevieve and Grew,
live in the next village over. Thinking about it for several minutes, you
decide whom to go to for help.

What would you like to do?

 1. Go to Denevieve for help.
 2. Go to Grew for help.
 3. Go alone.

As you take the magic shoes from the wizard's hand, he disappears in a puff
of smoke. You decide that you should give the shoes a try before you set
off to deal with the dragon (after all, if you learned nothing else in
school, it was that testing is VERY important). 

You put on the shoes and start jumping all over the village. As you bound
over fences and onto the roofs of small houses, your fellow villagers look
at you in awe. You are sure you could win any basketball game but are a
little more worried about how you will deal with a dragon.

As you take the magic toaster from the wizard's hand, he disappears in a
puff of smoke. You decide that you should give the toaster a try before you
set off to deal with the dragon (after all, if you learned nothing else in
school, it was that testing is VERY important). 

Having not had any breakfast, you are quite hungry, so testing the toaster
seems like a great solution to two problems. You grab a rock off the
ground, stuff it in, and think of delicious toast with raspberry jam. A few
seconds later, out pops the most perfectly done toast with just the right
amount of butter and jam. Wow that is good! You spend a while longer
testing the toaster again and again "just to be sure". After you are
stuffed on toast, you start to wonder how this will help you with the
dragon. 

Putting that question in the back of your mind, you contemplate whether or
not you should get some help before you set out. On the one hand, if you go
alone, you might be able to better sneak into the dragon's lair. On the

After thinking about it a bit, you decide that Denevieve is probably a
better choice. After all, her singing skills are likely to come in handy,
especially with your magic whistle. Maybe dragons can be tamed by choir
music and bird calls? That could be right, but you aren't sure--you slept
through that day of Magical Creature Biology class. 

After knocking on the door, Denevieve is surprised to hear about the dragon
threat but is happy to help you. After all, you were her best student and
tested every piece of code extensively and incrementally. Surely you can be
trusted with a quest about dragons.

The two of you set off into the hills and find the cave of the dragon. You
take a minute to confer about your musical options and come up with a short
list of three possible combinations to tame the dragon. 

What would you like to do?

 1. Silent Night, accompanied by raven calls
 2. Angels We Have Heard on High, accompanied by roosters crowing
 3. Bohemian Rhapsody, accompanied by the magestic call of a bald eagle

After thinking about it for a bit, you decide that Grew is the best
choice. You go to visit him, and explain your plan: Grew will make some
cinnamon almond cupcakes with dark chocolate ganache, and you will seranade
the dragon with your bird calls. Together, you will put the dragon in such
a good mood that you can befriend him and convince him to leave your
villages alone. 

Sadly, while the dragon does find the cupcakes delicious, he wants
something else to go with them. 

You have been eaten by a dragon.

Sorry, you have lost. Better luck next time!

After thinking about it for a bit, you decide to go alone. You head off
into the hills by yourself in search of the dragon. Unfortunately, while
you are walking and trying to think up a plan, the dragon swoops down
behind you and devours you.

After thinking about it for a bit, you decide Denevieve is a better
choice. After all she teaches undergraduate Dynamics, so surely that can
help you fight a dragon? 

After you explain your quest and demonstrate your magic shoes, Denevieve
pulls out a whiteboard and explains how to make it work: 

"First, we need to model the dragon as a rigid body and your magic shoes as
a point mass. Then we apply Lagrangeâ€™s Equations and... hmm this would be
much easier if the dragon's cave were a frictionless surface, but we
probably can't assume that, so instead (she writes big complicated equation
and does a bunch of calculus)... Ok, you need to jump right here on the top
of the dragon's head." She says, indicating a point on the dragon's head in
her free-body diagram. 

The two of you set off to the dragon's cave, and you carefully jump at
exactly the right place while Denevieve distracts the dragon with a lecture
about Coulomb friction. Your mighty jump knocks the dragon
unconscious. While the dragon is passed out, you tie him up.

When the dragon wakes up, you work out an agreement where the dragon will
learn C++ programming and earn his food by writing software instead of
stealing it. 

Everyone lives happily ever after.

Congratulations! You have won. Hooray!

After thinking about it for a bit, you decide to go to Grew for help. Grew
thinks about your problem for a while, and the best idea he can come up
with is to challenge the dragon to a game of basketball. After all, you do
have magic shoes that would let you dunk quite easily. 

The two of you set off to the dragon's cave, and the dragon agrees to your
challenge. Unfortunately, even being able to jump 10 feet in the air, the
dragon, who is 20 feet tall and can fly, can still block all your shots and
dunk over your head. The dragon wins the game and eats both you and Grew.

You have been eaten by a dragon.

Sorry, you have lost. Better luck next time!

You take out your whistle and Denevieve starts to sing

"Mama, just killed a man"
"Put a gun against his head"
"Pulled my trigger, now he's dead"
"Mama, life had just begun"
"But now I've gone and thrown it all away"

As Denevieve sings and you make bird calls, the dragon comes out of his
cave looking quite amused. He sings along with you all for a while, but
when you hit "Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth"

the dragon roars "INDEED YOU DO! AND THE TRUTH IS YOU LOOK TASTY!"

The dragon eats you.

Sorry, you have lost. Better luck next time!

After thinking about it for a bit, you decide that Denevieve is the better
choice. You go to her house and explain your quest. 

"Why don't we make some mimosas to go with the toast, and take them to the
dragon? That would surely placate him," she suggests. 

You agree that mimosas are a great idea. Of course, it seems like you
should probably make quite a lot of mimosas for a dragon. The two of you
set off to the local grocery store, Troll Foods (yes, run by real
trolls--but they are nice) and acquire supplies. You decide on 20 liters of
orange juice and 20 liters of sparkling wine.

You take the supplies back to your house and start making mimosas. As you
do this, you remember the most important thing you learned in Denevieve's
class: testing is important. The first mimosa is great, but you remember
that one test case is not enough. After 10 mimosas worth of test cases, you
are very sure that they are good, but also that you are really drunk. 

You take your remaining mimosas to the dragon's cave and call out to him 

"Hey dagron. I've gotss some drinkss and toasht for you."

The dragon slithers out of his cave intrigued by your offer. As you go to
make toast, you realize you are too drunk to operate your magic toaster. 

The dragon eats you instead, while sipping on a mimosa.

You have been eaten by a dragon.

Sorry, you have lost. Better luck next time!

After thinking about it for a bit, you decide to go to Grew for help. When
you explain your quest, and that you have a magic toaster, Grew gets an
idea. 

"Well, dragons really love to eat, so lets just give them a better option
than the animals in the area!" Grew exclaims. He goes on to explain how you
will create the best all-you-can-eat brunch buffet ever. Grew will arrange
for berries, smoked salmon, pastries, and you will provide literally
all-you-can-eat toast with the magic toaster. 

You swing by Troll Foods, the local grocery store (yes, run by real
trolls--but they are nice trolls) and pick up the supplies: 10 kg of smoked
salmon, 20 kg of mixed berries, and 100 pastries.

Upon arriving at the dragon's cave, you lay out the buffet and start making
toast. The dragon is so happy with the food, and thrilled that he can make
all the toast he wants, that he agrees to stop eating people's farm
animals, on one condition: you and Grew have to come back each week and
have brunch with him.

You all live happily ever after.

Congratulations! You have won. Hooray!

#angels we have heard on high
You take out your whistle and Denevieve starts to sing

"Angels we have heard on high" (COCKADOODLEDO)
"Sweetly singing o'er the plains" (COCKADOODLEDO).
"And the mountains in reply" (COCKADOODLEDO).
"Echoing their joyous strains" (COCKADOODLEDO).

As Denevieve sings and you make bird calls, the dragon comes out of his
cave looking quite angry. 

"WHO DARES DISTURB MY SLUMBER... Oh hello. You look tasty."

The dragon eats you.

Sorry, you have lost. Better luck next time!
