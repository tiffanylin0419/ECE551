As you bask in the morning light pouring through the bakery windows,
your breath is taken away by the stunning display of pastries in the case.

"What would you like?" The shop keeper ask cheerily.  Realizing you
have a long journey ahead of you, you decide it is best to order
one, but choosing is so hard.

What would you like to do?

1.Purchase a chocolate croissant.
2.Purchase an eclair.
3.Purchase a muffin.
You pay the baker, who puts your croissant into a bag,
and hands it to you.  He wishes you a good day.


What would you like to do?

1.Leave the store
As you leave the store, something feels...strange about the morning.
You aren't quite sure what, but you sense that something unusual
and strange is about to happen.  The street in front of you runs
east, out of town, or west deeper into town.  

What would you like to do?

1.Go east, out of town
2.Go west, into town
As you head out of town, you notice a shadow pass over you as
something large flies over your head.

What would you like to do?

1.Jump off the road and hide behind a large rock
2.Keep walking
Good thing you jumped behind a rock!  A large dragon swooped
down and landed on the road right where you just were.
The dragon looks hungry and ferocious...

What would you like to do?

1.Offer the dragon your last coins.
2.<UNAVAILABLE>
3.Offer the dragon the chocolate croissant.
4.<UNAVAILABLE>
5.<UNAVAILABLE>
6.Ask the dragon if he has heard any good jokes lately.
"Oh thank you this looks delicious!" the dragon says
as he devours the pastry.   "I was so hungry I couldn't
think straight and was about to eat you!  How terrible
would that have been."

Having solved the dragon's hunger problems, he is happy
to give you a ride back to your house.  Everyone lives
happily ever after.

Congratulations! You have won. Hooray!
