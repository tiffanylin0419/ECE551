As you bask in the morning light pouring through the bakery windows,
your breath is taken away by the stunning display of pastries in the case.

"What would you like?" The shop keeper ask cheerily.  Realizing you
have a long journey ahead of you, you decide it is best to order
one, but choosing is so hard.

What would you like to do?

1.Purchase a chocolate croissant.
2.Purchase an eclair.
3.Purchase a muffin.
You pay the baker, who puts your muffin into a bag,
and hands it to you.  He wishes you a good day.


What would you like to do?

1.Leave the store
As you leave the store, something feels...strange about the morning.
You aren't quite sure what, but you sense that something unusual
and strange is about to happen.  The street in front of you runs
east, out of town, or west deeper into town.  

What would you like to do?

1.Go east, out of town
2.Go west, into town
As you wander through town, you notice the blacksmith working on a
shiny, glowing sword.  He looks up from his work and says
"You look like the sort of hero who might need a sword?
Strange things in the air, can't go wrong with a sword.."
Checking your pockets, you find a few coins left after
your pastry purchase, but you would be broke if your
spent your money on the sword.

What would you like to do?

1.Buy the sword
2.Decline and head out of town
As you head out of town, you notice a shadow pass over you as
something large flies over your head.

What would you like to do?

1.Jump off the road and hide behind a large rock
2.Keep walking
Unfortunately the shadow flying overhead was a large
hungry dragon, who swooped down and ate you for breakfast.

Sorry, you have lost. Better luck next time!
