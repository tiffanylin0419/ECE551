As you bask in the morning light pouring through the bakery windows,
your breath is taken away by the stunning display of pastries in the case.

"What would you like?" The shop keeper ask cheerily.  Realizing you
have a long journey ahead of you, you decide it is best to order
one, but choosing is so hard.

What would you like to do?

1.Purchase a chocolate croissant.
2.Purchase an eclair.
3.Purchase a muffin.
You pay the baker, who carefully packs your eclair into a box
and hands it to you.  He wishes you a good day.


What would you like to do?

1.Leave the store
As you leave the store, something feels...strange about the morning.
You aren't quite sure what, but you sense that something unusual
and strange is about to happen.  The street in front of you runs
east, out of town, or west deeper into town.  

What would you like to do?

1.Go east, out of town
2.Go west, into town
As you head out of town, you notice a shadow pass over you as
something large flies over your head.

What would you like to do?

1.Jump off the road and hide behind a large rock
2.Keep walking
Good thing you jumped behind a rock!  A large dragon swooped
down and landed on the road right where you just were.
The dragon looks hungry and ferocious...

What would you like to do?

1.Offer the dragon your last coins.
2.<UNAVAILABLE>
3.<UNAVAILABLE>
4.Squirt the eclair filling in the dragon's eye.
5.<UNAVAILABLE>
6.Ask the dragon if he has heard any good jokes lately.
That choice is not available at this time, please try again
You offer the last of your money to the dragon, who seems a bit surprised.
"Oh thank you!" he says.  Now, I can just go buy some breafkast
at the bakery rather than eating travelers who wander on the roadways.

And everyone lived happily ever after.

Congratulations! You have won. Hooray!
