As you wander through town, you notice the blacksmith working on a
shiny, glowing sword.  He looks up from his work and says
"You look like the sort of hero who might need a sword?
Strange things in the air, can't go wrong with a sword.."
Checking your pockets, you find a few coins left after
your pastry purchase, but you would be broke if your
spent your money on the sword.
