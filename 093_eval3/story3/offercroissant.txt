"Oh thank you this looks delicious!" the dragon says
as he devours the pastry.   "I was so hungry I couldn't
think straight and was about to eat you!  How terrible
would that have been."

Having solved the dragon's hunger problems, he is happy
to give you a ride back to your house.  Everyone lives
happily ever after.
