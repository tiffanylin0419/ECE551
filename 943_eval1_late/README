This assignment is just for students who need to submit eval 1 late.
If you submit to this assignment, it will run the pregrader as it would for eval1

If you submit to this assignment, we will take your submission here as a late
(or re-submission) of eval1.

You still need to run

honor-statement 943_eval1_late

to be able to submit this assignment.   After you do so, nothing new will be
put into this directory.  Instead, you will want to

cp -r ../043_eval1/*  ./

to copy everything you have done so far from eval 1 to this directory.
